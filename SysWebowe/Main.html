         <span class="floated">The most commonly used data application on mobile phones is SMS text messaging. The first SMS text
                    message was sent from a computer to a mobile phone in 1992 in the UK, while the first person-to-person SMS from
                    phone to phone was sent in Finland in 1993.
                </span>
        Credit for the invention of the electric telephone is frequently disputed, and new controversies over the
        issue
        have arisen from time-to-time. Charles Bourseul, Antonio Meucci, Johann Philipp Reis, Alexander Graham Bell,
        and Elisha Gray, amongst others, have all been credited with the telephone's invention. The early history of
        the telephone became and
        still remains a confusing morass of claims and counterclaims, which were not clarified by the huge mass of
        lawsuits to resolve the
        patent claims of many individuals and commercial competitors. The Bell and Edison patents, however, were
        commercially decisive,
        because they dominated telephone technology and were upheld by court decisions in the United States.

        Early telephones were technically diverse. Some used liquid transmitters which soon went out of use.
        Some were dynamic: their diaphragms vibrated a coil of wire in the field of a permanent magnet or vice
        versa.
        This kind survived in small numbers through the 20th century in military and maritime applications where its
        ability to create its own electrical power was crucial. Most, however, used Edison/Berliner carbon
        transmitters,
        which were much louder than the other kinds, even though they required induction coils, actually acting as
        impedance matching transformers to make it compatible to the line impedance. The Edison patents kept
        the Bell monopoly viable into the 20th century, by which time telephone networks were more important than
        the instrument.

        By 1904 over three million phones in the U.S.[20] were connected by manual switchboard exchanges.
        By 1914, the U.S. was the world leader in telephone density and had more than twice the teledensity of
        Sweden,
        New Zealand, Switzerland, and Norway. The relatively good performance of the U.S. occurred despite competing
        telephone
        networks not interconnecting. What turned out to be the most popular and longest lasting physical style of
        telephone
        was introduced in the early 20th century, including Bell's model 102 telephone. A carbon granule transmitter
        and electromagnetic
        receiver were united in a single molded plastic handle, which when not in use were placed in a cradle in the
        base unit.

        Internet Protocol (IP) telephony, also known as Internet telephony or Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP),
        is a disruptive technology that is rapidly gaining ground against traditional telephone network
        technologies.
        In Japan and South Korea up to 10% of subscribers switched to this type of telephone service as of January
        2005.
        IP telephony uses a broadband Internet service to transmit conversations as data packets. In addition to
        replacing
        the traditional plain old telephone service (POTS) systems, IP telephony also competes with mobile phone
        networks by
        offering free or lower cost service via WiFi hotspots. VoIP is also used on private wireless networks which
        may or may not
        have a connection to the outside telephone network.

            <div class="text_format_1"><p>A mobile phone (also known as a cellular phone, cell phone, hand phone, or simply a
            phone) is a phone that can make and receive telephone calls over a radio link while moving around a wide
            geographic area. It does so by connecting to a cellular network provided by a mobile phone operator,
            allowing access to the public telephone network. By contrast, a cordless telephone is used only within the
            short range of a single, private base station.</p></div>
